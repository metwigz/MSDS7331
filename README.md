# Diabetes Patient Readmission Prediction
Using the diabetes data set we attempted to predict patient readmission based on 47 factors. The techniques used in this analysis included KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost. The second general task was to do clustering to provide additional insight. This included seeing if the data would naturally cluster by diabetes type. For this we used KMeans, MiniBatchKMeans, GaussianMixture, AgglomerativeClustersing, and DBSCAN. The interpretation and details of these tasks are available in the individual ipynb files in the notebook folder.

The data set used in this analysis was procured from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetes-hospital-readmission/data
